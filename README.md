# C-Standard-Library
My implementation of C18 Standard Library


Main priorities are for education. This implementation is not intended to be the fastest, or even the most secure. It is intended to be a learning exercise for not only me, but also to help teach others who might be interested in how the C library works. My goal is to implement the C standard library in such a way that its functionality is self-evident and intuitive. I also intend to fully document my thought process through a project wiki page for anyone who might want a more in-depth explanation.

Any critiques are welcome, including code formatting. However, I do request that if you are to critique something, please include an explanation as to why the change should be made, whether it be a performance gain, security measure, code clarity, or so on.
